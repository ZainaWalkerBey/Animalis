			<h2>Thinking About the Future</h2>
			<p><b>More than 15,000 animals are going endangered, but are soon to be extinct. This is truly shocking! As humans,<br> we may not think about the lives of creatures that we do not encounter in our daily lives. Despite this dearth of<br> presence, we should still try our best to make sure that these endangered / extinct animals are safe. We hope<br> that this website can allow people to be informed of the great jeopardy that animals are facing and encouraged<br> people to do whatever they can to save these animals, our future. </b>
